# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — AppDimens Dynamic

> [!NOTE]
> **Version:** `1.0.1` — modules: [MODULES.md](MODULES.md)

## 1. Executive Summary

**AppDimens Dynamic** is a mathematical scaling engine for Kotlin Multiplatform (`com.appdimens.kmp`). Its purpose is to map generic UI dimensions (developed against a `300dp` or equivalent reference) to physical window parameters—scaling elegantly across phones, tablets, desktop windows, and unpredictable foldables, on Android, JVM, iOS, macOS, the web (Kotlin/JS + wasmJs), Linux and Windows.

It encapsulates **scaling strategies** (curves) shipped as Maven modules, alongside an autonomous **Resize/Constraint** subsystem that finds the largest fitting size via binary search.

## 2. Market Context & Problem Space

Static `dp` measurements fall apart as device variety increases. A `300dp` horizontal card fits perfectly on a classic phone but becomes aggressively small on high-density tablets or wide-screen foldables.

### Core Objectives
1. **Mathematical Consistency:** Provide reproducible scaling curves (Linear, Logarithmic, Power).
2. **Unified Surface APIs:** Symmetrical integration rules for Compose Multiplatform (`compose.*`) and non-Compose code (`code.*`, with a platform-neutral `AppDimensContext` window handle).
3. **High-Frequency Performance:** Accommodate zero-allocation hot paths using lock-free architecture for smooth `60FPS` and `120FPS` rendering algorithms.
4. **Hardware Awareness:** Adapt directly to `Configuration`, Display aspect ratios, Multi-Window flags, and Context DPI.
5. **Modular APK control:** Developers include only the strategy artifacts they need; the principal artifact must not pull all strategies.

## 4. Feature Requirements (FR)

### FR-0: Systemic Foundation & Architecture
- **FR-0.1 (Module Separation):** Each strategy must exist as an independent computational node. `compose.percent` cannot import `compose.power`.
- **FR-0.2 (Telemetry & Reading):** Raw dimensions must derive from the platform window configuration — on Android from `android.content.res.Configuration`, on desktop/web/iOS/macOS from the live window/viewport snapshot exposed as `ScreenConfiguration`, and on Linux/Windows native from a `ScreenConfiguration` you build (no windowing API in the Kotlin/Native stdlib — `defaultPlatformContext()` returns `null` there).
- **FR-0.3 (Platform Parity):** All Compose API nodes (`*DpExtensions`) must explicitly feature symmetric `code` equivalents for legacy migration.

### FR-1: Dimension Mathematics & Curves
> [!TIP]
> The `Scaled` default curve remains optimal for generic UI development, specifically supporting aspect-ratio injection (`sdpa`, `sdpi`) for anti-distortion tuning.

| Strategy Class | Mathematical Goal | Expected Consumer Use Case |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Scaled** (Default) | Linear geometry translation from basic `300dp` scale. | Baseline paddings, Standard containers. |
| **Logarithmic** | Fast early growth curve with heavy downstream damping. | Text geometries on massive tablets. |
| **Fluid** | Breakpoint-based linear interpolation \([320..768]\). | Responsive Web-like UI adjustments. |
| **Percent / Space** | Absolute device fractional limits (\( % \times sw \)). | Fixed grid splits, Nav bars. |
| **Interpolated** | Blend between base and linear scale (50%). | Softer growth than pure linear. |

### FR-2: Engine & Subsystem Resize Algorithms
- **FR-2.1 (Memory Integrity):** Generates constraint step buffers via static pre-allocated `FloatArray`. **No auto-boxing allowed.**
- **FR-2.2 (Processing):** Operates on an asymptotic \(\mathcal{O}(\log N)\) binary search protocol to match element sizing to physical screen limits.
- **FR-2.3 (Bounds & Safety):** Respect hardware metrics with `ResizeBound.resolveToPx` using strict `require(density > 0)` contracts.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

* **NFR-1 (Performance Benchmarking):** `shouldBypassCache` skips snapshot-cache I/O for multiply-only types (`PERCENT`, `SCALED`, `DENSITY`, `DIAGONAL`, `INTERPOLATED`, `PERIMETER`) and for `POWER` / `LOGARITHMIC` on the default SW path — including default aspect ratio when applicable. See [library/PERFORMANCE.md](../library/PERFORMANCE.md).
* **NFR-2 (Lock-Free Threading):** Lock-free, snapshot-partitioned cache. Each window/configuration snapshot (`DimenMetrics`) owns a fixed-size partition whose entries are published as a single immutable `CacheEntry` (key + value bits) through `AtomicReferenceArray`, so concurrent readers never observe another key’s value; no disk persistence.
* **NFR-3 (Minimum Environment):** `minSdk = 24`, Java 17 requirements, enforcing direct Proguard shipping via `consumer-rules.pro`.
* **NFR-4 (Runtime Diagnostics):** Engine observability functions remain conditionally gated (`diagnosticsEnabled`) to eliminate tracing overhead in production applications.

## 6. Metrics of Success
1. Integration on both Compose/XML environments without memory/GC stuttering.
2. Binary scale operations taking `< 15ns` median time.
3. Successful scaling to multi-window split structures automatically.
