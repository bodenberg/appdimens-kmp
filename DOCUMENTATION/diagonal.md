# Diagonal strategy (`compose.diagonal` / `code.diagonal`)

**Artifact:** `io.github.bodenberg:appdimens-dynamic-diagonal:1.0.0` (`:library-diagonal`)
See [MODULES.md](MODULES.md) · [README installation](../README.md#installation-v100)

**Same API surface as scaled** with prefixes `dgsdp` / `dghdp` / `dgwdp` / `dgssp` / … — see [COMPOSE-API-CONVENTIONS.md §3](COMPOSE-API-CONVENTIONS.md#3-strategy-prefix-map-mirror-of-scaled).

## What it is

**Diagonal** scales by the **length of the screen rectangle’s diagonal** in dp: it combines width and height into one number, reflecting “perceived canvas size” better than a single axis alone. The SDP/HDP/WDP qualifier **does not change** the diagonal used — the math always uses the current window’s shorter and longer side.

## Calculation used

Mathematically, for the current window:

- `shorter = min(widthDp, heightDp)`, `longer = max(...)`
- `diag = √(shorter² + longer²)`
- `scale = diag / BASE_DIAGONAL_DP` with `BASE_DIAGONAL_DP = √(300² + 533²) ≈ 611.63` (`DesignScaleConstants`).
- `out = base × scale`.

**Implementation note:** `scale` is derived from the immutable per-window snapshot (`DimenCache.currentMetrics`) at resolution time — no process-global pre-computation. The steps above describe what that factor represents; the default path does not recompute `√(shorter² + longer²)` on every call.

- With **`a`**: multiply by the per-window aspect-ratio factor (`DimenCache.currentAspectRatioMul`, derived in the immutable `DimenMetrics` snapshot); custom sensitivity uses `1 + k × logNormalizedAr`.

Implementation: `calculateDiagonalDpCompose` in `DimenDiagonalDp.kt`.

## How to use

```kotlin
import com.appdimens.dynamic.compose.diagonal.dgsdp

Modifier.size(64.dgsdp)
```

Main Compose prefixes: `dgsdp`, `dghdp`, `dgwdp` (plus `a` / `i` / `ia`, `Px`, inverters like `.dgsdpPh`, `.dgsdpLw`, … in `DimenDiagonalDp.kt`).

**Code:** `com.appdimens.dynamic.code.diagonal`.

## Why use it

Elements that should react to **overall canvas size** (games, dense dashboards, frames) rather than width or height alone.

## When to use it

- Balance **wide short** vs **tall narrow** screens fairly.
- When **sdp** or **wdp** alone skew visual hierarchy.

## Advantages and trade-offs

- **Pros:** one stable scalar for “how big is the screen” overall.
- **Cons:** less intuitive for designers used to width breakpoints; inverters have limited effect on the diagonal itself (the read axis changes, but the formula still uses the current sides).

## Recommended usage strategy

Reserve **diagonal** for specific components (e.g. board piece size, centered hero icon); keep lists and running text on **scaled** or **hdp**/**wdp** depending on the dominant axis.
